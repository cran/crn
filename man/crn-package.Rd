\section{basic operations}{
  The package provides the basic functions to download and organize 
  CRN data into R friendly datastructures. The first function that should
  be used is \code{downloadCRN}, That function downloads either daily
  or hourly data depending on the variables you pass it.
  Next, \code{collateDaily} and \code{collateHourly} should be run.
  Finally, \code{writeDataset} is used to create files with individual
  variables in them.
